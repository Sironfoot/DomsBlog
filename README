This was my first attempt at an ASP.NET MVC application. As a result it's a bit crap, no unit testing, little in the way of SOLID coding principles etc. Have a look if you like, but be warned. Maybe I'll get around to improving it, maybe I won't, but there are much better blogging engines out there.
